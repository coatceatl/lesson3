    <h1>The Wizard of Oz</h1>
    <h2>CHAPTER 1 - The Ciclone</h2>
    <p>
      Dorothy lived in the middle of the great Kansas praire, with Uncle Henry, who was a farver,
      and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.Their house was small, with four walls, a floor and
      a roof, which made one room; and this room had an old cooking stove, a cupboard for the
      dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Hanry and Aunt Em gad a big bed
      in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in anoder corner. There was ano second floor at all,
      and no cellar - except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the
      family could go in case a cyclone came up, one of those strong winds strong enough to destroy
      any building in its path. The cellar was reached by a small door in the middle of the floor,
      with a ladder that went down into the small, dark hole.

    <p>It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her home.</p>
