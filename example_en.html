    <h2>CHAPTER 1 - The Ciclone</h2>
    <p>
      Dorothy lived in the middle of the great Kansas praire, with Uncle Henry, who was a farver,
      and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.Their house was small, with four walls, a floor and
      a roof, which made one room; and this room had an old cooking stove, a cupboard for the
      dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Hanry and Aunt Em gad a big bed
      in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in anoder corner. There was ano second floor at all,
      and no cellar - except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the
      family could go in case a cyclone came up, one of those strong winds strong enough to destroy
      any building in its path. The cellar was reached by a small door in the middle of the floor,
      with a ladder that went down into the small, dark hole.

      It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her home.Toto
      was not gray;he was a little black dog, with long silky hair, small black eyes and a funny
      little nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.
    </p>

      Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and looked
      anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in the door with Toto
      in her arms, and looked at the sky too, Aunt Em was washing the dishes.

      From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could see
      where the long grass made waves before the coming storm. There now came a sharp whistling in
      the air from the south,and as they looked that waythey saw more waves in the grass coming
      from that direction also.

      Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.<br><q>There's a cyclone coming, Em,</q> he called to his
      wife. <q>I'll go look after the animals.</q><br>Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows
      and horses were.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One look told her of the danger close at hand.
      <q>Quick, Dorothy!</q> she screamed. <q>Run for the cellar!</q>
